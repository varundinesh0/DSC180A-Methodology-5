**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in the domain this quarter was predicting psychological disorder status of children from multimodal data
that includes data from different setting including the functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, galvanic skin response, and facial video data collected during a
frustration-inducing task. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation would be to anaylze different models and embeddings on a larger dataset with many more children in order to support the results created
in the previous study. There are different models that could be used to anaylze the facial feature data during the frustratin-inducing task that the children in the
study had to complete. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change we would make to the approach taken in Quarter 1 is to potentially make an app through iphone/ipad that runs the frustration inducing task and 
can create a report from our created models that anaylze the facial features for whoever is playing the task.  

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Some other techniques I would be interested in using in my project include pytorch vision model, resnet 18 model, and exploring deepface which is a face attribute analysis pipeline.
